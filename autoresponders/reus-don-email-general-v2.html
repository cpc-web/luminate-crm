<p>Dear [[?xx::x[[S1:first_name]]x::Friend::[[S1:first_name]]]],</p>

<p>Thank you for your recent contribution in support of Central Park Conservancy.  We are truly grateful for your gift of [[S120:dc:giftAmount]], which will directly support the restoration, management, and enhancement of Central Park. Thank you for partnering with the Conservancy to care for New York&#8217;s greatest landmark, Central Park. </p>

<p>When you explore the Park this season, we hope that you will take note of the many ways that your gift is working to improve your Park experience and that of our other 40 million annual visitors. In providing the operating support that Central Park Conservancy depends upon, you are empowering our horticulture experts and zone gardeners to care for our lawns and meadows, tend to the multitude of flowers and shrubs that beautify our pathways, and maintain a healthy habitat for fish and fowl in our diverse array of water bodies. Your gift brings Central Park to life.</p>

<p>Did you know that many employers will double, or even triple, the impact of your gift through a matching gift program? Be sure to ask your Human Resources department if your company participates in a corporate matching program and ask them to join you in supporting Central Park Conservancy, or visit <a href="http://www.matchinggifts.com/centralparknyc/">http://matchinggifts.com/centralparknyc</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you for your support of Central Park Conservancy!</p>

<p>Warm regards,</p>

<p>Douglas Blonsky<br/>
President & CEO, Central Park Conservancy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and Central Park Administrator</p>
